Static Website Project Designed and Developed by: Jonathan Allen Mina

"Yakibun"

This is a personal project website built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

This website was built using web development technologies like HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements. It also leverages the Bootstrap framework for a responsive and modern design. Key features include a clean user interface and full responsiveness across different devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop). I'm learning ReactJS right now, and I'll soon make this project better. I hope so..
